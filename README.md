C-Sharp-XNA-BallPhysics-Project
===============================

A soccer-game-type project.

This is a prototype of a soccer game that I wrote to learn C# back around 2010-2011.

The main feature I implemented was a physics system for the realistic behavior of my soccer ball.
In addition to gravity, I implemented friction drag, collision detection and bouncing (off the
cyllindrical components of the frame of the goal), and spin.

I made a little video at the time, and posted it on youtube:

After writing the physics module, I implemented a basic AI and tried to setup an 11 on 11 soccer game.
Around then school started again and I had to focus on other things.
